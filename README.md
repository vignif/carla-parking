# Carla parking with ROS
Carla is an open source simulator for autonomous driving research available at <http://carla.org/>

This package contains an implemantation of a **rule based parking motion**. It is an open-loop approach for the task, given that no information are retrieved from sensors and crashes can occur.

The example spawns 2 cars in predefined positions (leaving enough space between them) and the ego vehicle is blindly controlled to fit the parking spot.

## Example
this gif shows the implemented routine with a time scale x5
![](.figure/m1_comp.gif)

## Installation
<catkin_ws> = name of your catkin workspace

```cd ~/<catkin_ws>/src```

```git clone https://github.com/vignif/carla_parking.git```

```cd ..```

```catkin_make ```

## Environment for running

run carla with ```./CarlaUE4.sh``` as from <https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/>

run carla ros bridge with
```roslaunch carla_ros_bridge carla_ros_bridge.launch```

## Running

```source devel/setup.bash```

```rosrun carla_park park.py```

### Specs
park.py implements a basic parking policy for autonomous cars based on geometric information
This script spawns:
* one ego vehicle in x=61.4, y=-7.62, z=0.05
* two vehicle inside the parking location a side of the ego vehicle respectively in x=60.4, y=-10.62, z=0.05 and x=47.0, y=-10.62, z=0.05
* a camera attached to the ego vehicle for future sensor based parking policy
* Carla world set to Town 03 [carla_maps](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_map/#carla-maps)



all the vehicles are rotated of 180' in order to be correctly in line with the street

tested env:
1. Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
2. UnrealEngine 4.22
3. ROS melodic
4. carla 0.9.7
